**Send emails directly from Google spreadsheets using your Gmail A/C to all of the receiver listed on your sheet**
In the case of mass mailing, using Gmail's Cc Bcc is a bad practice. That can send emails to everybody but all of the email addresses are exposed to everyone, that's a security threat. This script sends each email separately in an instance and no emails are revealed, plus we can send emails using a specific receiver's name that makes the email appealing. 

**Note**
-Google allows 100 emails a day per Gmail A/C
-Use multiple A/C to send if you have more than 100 mails
-Format spreadsheet just like the MassMail.xlsx or change the code to work for you
